# WeatherApp-Flask

Things I added:
City, Country Data Fetch
Temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin Data Fetch
Error Handling

Things I want to add:
Real-Time Forecast Data: Extend the app to display a multi-day weather forecast for the selected city. You can use the Weatherstack API to fetch forecast data and present it to the user.

Location Detection: Implement geolocation to automatically detect the user's location and display the weather for their current location without the need to input a city manually.
