# WeatherApp-with-Python-Flask
Things I want to add:

Forecast Data: Extend the app to display a multi-day weather forecast for the selected city. You can use the Weatherstack API to fetch forecast data and present it to the user.

Location Detection: Implement geolocation to automatically detect the user's location and display the weather for their current location without the need to input a city manually.

Unit Conversion: Allow users to switch between different units for temperature (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit) and wind speed (e.g., km/h and mph). Provide a user-friendly option to toggle between units.

Historical Data: Incorporate historical weather data for the selected city, allowing users to view past weather conditions and trends.

Weather Alerts: Implement real-time weather alerts and notifications for severe weather conditions in the selected city.

Multiple Locations: Enable users to add and save multiple locations to check the weather in their favorite or frequently visited places.

Interactive Map: Integrate an interactive map that shows weather conditions across various locations with clickable markers for detailed weather information.

User Accounts: Create user accounts and profiles, allowing users to save their preferred locations, customize settings, and receive personalized weather updates.

Weather Widgets: Offer weather widgets that users can embed on their websites or mobile devices for quick access to weather information.

Historical Charts: Generate charts and graphs to visualize historical weather data, such as temperature trends over time.

Weather Advisories: Provide weather advisories and tips based on the current weather conditions, such as dressing appropriately for the weather.

Language Support: Support multiple languages so that users can view weather information in their preferred language.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the app is responsive and works well on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.

Offline Access: Implement offline caching and access, so users can still view previously fetched weather data when they don't have an internet connection.

API Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting and caching strategies to minimize the number of API calls and improve performance.

Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide informative messages to users when there are issues with fetching weather data or other errors.

Social Sharing: Allow users to share weather updates on social media platforms.
